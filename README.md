# Celeb-Face-Generation
Jupyter notebook exploring GANS for face generation, using the Celeb A data set.

This project was done as part of the  [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) from Udacity

Using the [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) to train an adversarial network.
The images have already been cropped down to just the faces,  and then resized to 64x64x3 NumPy images.
